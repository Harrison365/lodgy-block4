Write a function called solve.

Solve should be given an integer n and find two integers a and b such that:

1. a >= 0 and b >= 0
2. a + b = n
3. The sum of a's digits + the sum of b's digits is the maximum of all possibilities.

Solve will return the sum of a's digits + the sum of b's digits

For example:
solve(22) = 13
because, if we take 19 + 3 = 22 and digitSum = 1 + 9 + 3 = 13, there is no larger outcome.
Even though 20 + 2 also equals 22, 2 + 0 + 2 = is not greater than 1 + 9 + 3.

Good luck!
